# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

### Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

>> Tuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via unpacking or indexing. Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.  Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You canâ€™t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().

### Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

>> **Sets** are *Unordered collections of unique elements* --> ie: all words used in a speech
**Lists** are *ordered collections of elements* --> ie: telephone number respository

#List
fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana']
fruits.count('apple')

#Set
engineers = Set(['John', 'Jane', 'Jack', 'Janice'])
programmers = Set(['Jack', 'Sam', 'Susan', 'Janice'])
managers = Set(['Jane', 'Jack', 'Susan', 'Zack'])
employees = engineers | programmers | managers  


sets allows you to do operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference.  Sets doesn't allow indexing and are implemented on hash tables.  Lists are variable-length arrays. In lists the elements are accessed by indices.  When you want to store some values which you'll be iterating over, Python's list constructs are slightly faster. However, if you'll be storing (unique) values in order to check for their existence, then sets are significantly faster (constant time not based on size of set).
